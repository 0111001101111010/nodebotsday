# Nodebots Day 7/27

Let's hack some fun!

Follow-up to last year's [Node.js Hardware Hack Weekend](https://github.com/dshaw/hard-hack-2012). Now with 100% more international. Join us. Gather a group of people near you too.

This is not a hackathon. There will be no prizes other than the satisfaction of making something awesome! There will be very little in the way of talks. We're going to get together, collaborate and hack. This is more NodeConf SummerCamp than NodeConf. Sharing. Enjoying each other's company. Learning and exploring. And JavaScript. Lots of JavaScript.
