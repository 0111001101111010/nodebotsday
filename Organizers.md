# International Nodebots Day Organizers

Want to organize a Nodebots Day near you? You should. This is a community event and it will be largely what you make it. A few of us have organized similar events and here we'll share some of the things you'll probably want to pull together and what's worked for us.

## The Basics

* Get a space.
    * There will probably be some people who are going to be soldering. Make sure there's an area that's well ventilated for this.
    * Make sure there are enough tables and power outlets/strips for everyone - you'll need enough hookups for computers and robots.
    
* Food, snacks and beverages
    * Warning: this can eat up a lot of your money. This is a great contribution/sponsorship oportunity.
    
* Signup form
    * If you don't need to collect money from anyone, I'd be happy to add a Tito event page for you. Create an [issue](https://github.com/dshaw/nodebotsday/issues) or mention it in the pull request for your event and I'll add you. https://tito.io/nodebotsday/

## Hardware

* Another area where you can sink some money into this event.
* Note that you could potentially run this *totally BYOH (Bring Your Own Hardware)*.
* Bringing in a diverse spectrum of Arduino, Raspberry Pi, sensors, copters, robotic arms, etc makes things fun. Get creative, but above all elicit contributions!
* Not hardware necessarily, but cheap and immensely useful:
    * popsicle sticks of different sizes
    * glue gun(s) and glue sticks
    * spare cardboard
    * exacto knives/box cutters
* Starter kits that may be useful:
